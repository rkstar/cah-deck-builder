## Uploading your decks to playingcards.io
this program will output two files: `prompt.csv` and `response.csv` based on your selections. you will have to use the **remote insensitivity** game template on the site, then go into edit mode.

once in edit mode, you can click on the card decks and `Add/Remove Cards`. at the bottom of the current list of cards, you'll see a button labeled `IMPORT CSV`. use this button to import the appropriate `prompt.csv` or `response.csv` files generated by this program.
